# Image-To-Divs
Using the MarvinJ JavaScript library, I was able to make an online image converter that allows you to upload and convert images to pure CSS divs. There many not be much use for this program (except for maybe making captchas harder to bypass with AI), but I always like pushing the limits of what's possible in coding.
